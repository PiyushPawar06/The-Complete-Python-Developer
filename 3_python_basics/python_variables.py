# variables are used to  assign the values 
name = "Piyush" # here the name is the variable and piyush is the assigned vlaue
print(name)

# unsaid rules for variables 
# 1. always start a variable name with lowercase or underscore
# 2. always have snake_case pattern example:- student_name
# 3. don't  use the name same as keywords
# 4. keep it case senative(lowercase)
# 5. it can consist of alphabets,underscore and numbers

# variables can be used to reassign another variable eg:- a = 9, b = a 
a = 9
b = a
print(b)

a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a,b,c)
# constants are those values that do not change, keep the constants into uppercase for ease
